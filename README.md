## Student Discipline Management System using Neural Networks

Small description about the project like one below
The objective of this study is to design and develop a robust Neural Network-Based Student Disciplinary Management System for educational institutions.

## About
<!--Detailed Description about the project-->
The Neural Network Based Student Disciplinary Management System is a comprehensive solution designed to improve and automate the management of student disciplinary actions within educational institutions. This system utilizes neural network technology to analyze and predict student behavior, allowing administrators to proactively address potential issues and promote a positive learning environment. The system collects data from various sources, including student records, attendance, and behavioral incidents, and applies machine learning algorithms to identify patterns and trends in student behavior.
## Features
<!--List the features of the project as shown below-->
Advanced Backbone and Neck Architectures: YOLOv8 employs state-of-the-art backbone and neck architectures, resulting in improved feature extraction and object detection performance.
Anchor-free Split Ultralytics Head: YOLOv8 adopts an anchor-free split Ultralytics head, which contributes to better accuracy and a more efficient detection process compared to anchor-based approaches.
Optimized Accuracy-Speed Tradeoff: With a focus on maintaining an optimal balance between accuracy and speed, YOLOv8 is suitable for real-time object detection tasks in diverse application areas.

## Output
<!--Embed the Output picture at respective places as shown below as shown below-->
Backbone: This is the main body of the network. For YOLOv8, the backbone is designed using the New CSP-Darknet53 structure, a modification of the Darknet architecture used in previous versions.
Neck: This part connects the backbone and the head. In YOLOv8, SPPF and New CSP-PAN structures are utilized.
Head: This part is responsible for generating the final output. YOLOv8 uses the YOLOv3 Head for this purpose

## Results and Impact
<!--Give the results and impact as shown below-->
In conclusion, the presented Intelligent Video Surveillance System represents a significant step forward in addressing the growing need for enhanced security measures in the face of increasing security threats and human abnormalities. By integrating the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection algorithm, the system achieves real-time detection and response capabilities, particularly focusing on human abnormality detection. The utilization of YOLO's state-of-the-art capabilities, such as simultaneous object identification and classification in a single pass through the network, positions the system as an efficient and accurate solution for identifying various forms of human abnormality.
